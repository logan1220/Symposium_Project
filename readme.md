# Nerd Herd

This is a group project for Spring 2017 COP3855. We are tasked to create a website for a business that uses E-Commerce.

We decided to create a company called Nerd Herd. This is a membership based social networking website that allows introverted typed people to find friends in their area!

More info to come.
